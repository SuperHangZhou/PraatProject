we have a script that can get the pitch, amplitude and intensity in 10ms intervals
>>PassBandFilterScript_wOralNasalChannelExtraction_wF0_dB_Pa<<
The pitch is undefined more often than expected_expecially for speaker with glottal fry
Will need a determinant other than pitch - eg dB level
Nasometer uses 50 dB min to either microphone but that's with their set up
Praat dB values are uncalibrated - depends on Monique's set up
For this test recording might take it to 20 dB limit (either microphone)
