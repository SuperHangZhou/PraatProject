##Band pass filter with its center frequency at 500 Hz, ##
##its low frequency (-3 dB) cutoff at 300 Hz, ##
##and its upper frequency cutoff at 750 Hz as per Nasometer 6450 manual##
##To approximate in Praat using pass Hann band##
## from 250 hz to 750 hz - smoothing 200 hz##
##May be an issue for male speakers with low F0##
##Also seperates nasal (1) and oral (2) channels##
##early versions gave Pitch amplitude and intensity of Channel 1&2 combined##
##this gives channel1 and two individually_July 13 2018##
